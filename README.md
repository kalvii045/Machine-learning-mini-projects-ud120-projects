# Machine-learning-mini-projects-ud120-projects
This repository includes solutions to the mini projects for ud120, Udacity's machine learning course. 
Each folder is a different machine learning technique or algorithm to determine who 
may have been a person of interest in the Enron scandal.

Some of the files are very large so it's not included here. The original project or the starter version can be found here
